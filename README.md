### Hi 👋, I'm Emanuela a passionate Full Stack developer from Italy 🇮🇹.

I've always been a creative person, I have a master degree in design and I have worked as a graphic designer for 3 years. <br>
In 2023 my curiosity and my need for challenge has brought me to want to learn to code what I used to design. <br>
That's how I discovered a passion! Coding is really challenging and I love to use my creativity to find the solutions I need to make what I imagine. <br>
