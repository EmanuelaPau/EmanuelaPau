### Hi 👋, I'm Emanuela a passionate Full Stack developer from Italy 🇮🇹.

🖌 I've always been a creative person 🎨✨, I have a master degree 📜 in design and I have worked as a graphic designer for 3 years. But It wasn't enough...<br>
💡 In 2023 my curiosity and my need for challenge has brought me to want to learn to code 💻 what I used to design. <br>
💭 That's how I discovered a passion❤️‍🔥! Coding is really challenging and I love to use my creativity to find the solutions I need to make what I imagine 📐. <br>
