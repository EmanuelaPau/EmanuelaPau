### Hi 👋, I'm Emanuela a passionate Full Stack developer from Italy 🇮🇹.

I've always been a creative person 🖌🎨✨, I have a master degree 📜 in design and I have worked as a graphic designer for 3 years. But I was unappy...<br>
In 2023 my curiosity and my need for challenge has brought me to want to learn to code 💻 what I used to design. <br>
That's how I discovered a passion💡! Coding is really challenging and I love to use my creativity to find the solutions 📐 I need to make what I imagine 💭. <br>
